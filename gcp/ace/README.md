## 1-Day Study Strategy

Since you use GCP daily, focus on:

1. **Skim all 5 domain files** - flag anything unfamiliar (~1-2 hours)
2. **Deep dive on weak spots** - especially Domain 3 (deploying) which is 25% of the exam (~1 hour)
3. **Review the CLI cheat sheet** - know the key commands for each service (~30 min)
4. **Do all practice questions** - aim for 85%+ before taking the real exam (~1-2 hours)
5. **Review wrong answers** - re-read the relevant domain sections (~30 min)

**Key exam trends:**
- Scenario-based questions (not pure memorization)
- Heavy on choosing the right service for a workload
- IAM and least-privilege principles come up frequently
- IaC (Terraform) is now part of the exam
- Cloud Operations suite (formerly Stackdriver) naming
